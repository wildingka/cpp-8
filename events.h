/*
	Event, LLNODE and LIST class declaration.
 
    Events include the name of the device, the type of event, and the time stamp.
	(Time-stamp 0 means this is urgent and should be processed before any other
	events.  Events are order be increasing time stamp.  Some events will not
	be processed until later times; for example, flashing a turn signal on and off
	happens every 3 seconds, so when it is turned on a new event is added for 3
	seconds later.
	
	An ordered linked list is used to store events.  A separate class is defined
	for the list nodes.
